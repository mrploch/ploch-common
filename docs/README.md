# Ploch.Common Documentation

## Overview

**Ploch.Common** is a collection of utility libraries that I was creating for my daily development needs.

Some time ago I decided to publish it. It still needs a lot of documentation because barely any exists, but thecode is
well-tested.

Hopefully, you'll find something useful there :)

## Libraries

### Ploch.Common

[Ploch.Common](../src/Common/README.md) contains extensions methods and utility classes for various core classes of
.NET.

### Ploch.Common.Data.Model

[Ploch.Common.Data.Model](../src/Common.Data/Data.Model/README.md) contains a set of interfaces and base classes for
building
model classes.
