Overview of Ploch.Data (https://github.com/mrploch/ploch-data)
This repository contains various projects for working with data in .NET.
It provides following features:
- A common data model for standardization for entities, bringing interfaces for things like
  - a type with Id
  - a type with Title
  - a type with Children and Parent properties making it best candidates for storing things like categories or folder structure in DB
  - and many more - https://github.com/mrploch/ploch-data/tree/main/src/Data.Model
- A Generic Repository which is the flagship of this repository. It brings a ready to use, battle-tested generic repository (https://github.com/mrploch/ploch-data/tree/main/src/Data.GenericRepository)
  - CRUD operations provided out-of-the-box.
  - Helps implementation of CQRS vaarious types of repositories:
    - IReadRepository, IReadRepositoryAsync - read only repositories for queries
    - IReadWriteRepository and IReadWriteRepositoryAsync - read / write repositories for commands
  - Finally provides Unit of Work pattern implementation
- Integration Testing library making it super easy to write integration tests, with real database (SQLite In-Memory), which provides full support and handling of all types of queries, including the complex ones.
