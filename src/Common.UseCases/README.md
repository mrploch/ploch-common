## Overview

This library contains a set of interfaces and base classes for implementing use cases.
It is a part of the [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
approach.

A use case is a piece of business logic that can be executed by the application.
It takes an input and optionally produces a result.
